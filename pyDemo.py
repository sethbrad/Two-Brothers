"""Python is an interpreted language. 
This means that is is not compiled but instead converted directly into machine code (binary)"""

"""Comments are ignored by the intepreter and wrapped in triple quotes like this"""

"""We use variables to store values"""
number = 7
word = "John"

"""All we need is a name and a value separated by the '=' sign. Each line is distinct"""
"""We can output strings to the console with the following syntax"""
print ("Hello, world!")

"""We can also do arithmetic on number variables"""
x = 4
y = 3
z = x + y

print (str(z))

"""Numbers can be compared as well, which gives a boolean value --> true or false"""
print (x < y)
print (z > x)
